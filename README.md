Viewport_Monkey
===============

Add a div and monkey to an HTML page to show you the viewport size

Handy for developing a Responsive Design, to see the size of the viewport when the window resizes.

Just link to jQuery... 

something like...
`<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>`

and link to the "viewport_monkey-0.1.js" file. Something like...
`<script src="js/viewport_monkey-0.1.js"></script>`

Then monkey will be added to the bottom of your viewport.
