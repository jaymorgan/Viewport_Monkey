Viewport_Monkey
===============

Adds a div and a monkey to display the viewport size to make finding breakpoints in Responsive Design easier.

When your page layout breaks, it gives you a number to base a media query on. I used a very early version of this to develop my portfolio site and found it very useful. 

This requires jQuery.
`<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>`

and link to the "viewport_monkey-0.1.js" file.
`<script src="js/viewport_monkey-0.1.js"></script>`

Then monkey will be added to the bottom of your viewport.

I don't have a ton of time to spend on this but I'm hoping to work on it more. Cheers!
