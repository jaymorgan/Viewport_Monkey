Viewport_Monkey
===============

This is a handy utility that just adds a simple readout to the corner of your page that tells you what the viewport width is. Great for designing a responsive sites in the browser. I don't work with standard breakpoints like some designers. I fix elements on the screen when they need fixing or when they look _a little off_. This utility makes it easy to find a good breakpoint for your media queries. 

## Requirements

This plugin requires __jQuery__.

## Installation

Just add the __viewport_monkey-v1.js__ file to your HTML
Then monkey will be added to the bottom of your viewport.

## Features

Use the "_px_" button to switch between Pixels and EMs and the arrow buttons to move the Monkey around the screen. 

## View Demo
